# Design System: as implemented

The brand philosophy, color rationale, typography scale, and icon rules live in **`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` (repo root): that file is the source of truth.** This doc covers how the system is actually wired into the code, including the few deliberate deviations.

## Tokens (`apps/web/src/app/globals.css`)

Tailwind v4 CSS-first theming. Raw values on `:root`, dark overrides on `.dark` (the `next-themes` class), and a `@theme inline` block mapping them to Tailwind utilities:

```css
:root {
  --background: #ffffff;
  --foreground: #0e1116;
  --brand-blue: #3a6dc5;
  --brand-yellow: #f7bf33;
  --brand-red: #f94141;
  --brand-green: #0f8657;
  --brand-blue-50: #ecf1fa;
  --brand-yellow-50: #fef6e0;
  --brand-red-50: #fee5e5;
  --brand-green-50: #e2f1ea;
  --ink-2: #3b4150;
  --ink-3: #6b7280;
  --line: #ececea;
  --surface-muted: #f7f7f5;
  --surface-inverse: #0e1116;
  --pattern-canvas: var(--surface-muted);
}
.dark {
  --background: #0e1116;
  --foreground: #ededed;
  --line: #262a33;
  --surface-muted: #15181e;
}
```

`@theme inline` maps: `--color-background`, `--color-foreground`, `--color-brand-*` (4 colors + 4 tints), `--font-sans/-mono/-display` from the next/font variables. Utilities in use: `bg-brand-blue`, `text-foreground`, `bg-[var(--surface-muted)]` (for values not in `@theme`), `font-display`, etc.

**`--pattern-canvas`**: the "white" half of every pattern tile (`public/patterns/*.svg`) is this variable, not literal white, so tiles never render as white squares on dark surfaces.

### Deliberate deviations from DESIGN_SYSTEM.md

- **Core Competencies card yellow**: `#FFBC00` (more saturated one-off) instead of `--brand-yellow #f7bf33`. Defined locally in `core-competencies.tsx` (`CARD_BG.yellow`), with a comment explaining why: the reference design uses this shade only on that card. Don't "fix" it to the token.
- **Menu sizing** is a separate fluid system (dvh-clamped, em-based). See `docs/navigation-menu.md` §Sizing.

## Fonts

Geist Sans / Geist Mono / Hanken Grotesk via `next/font` in `layout.tsx` (variables `--font-geist-sans`, `--font-geist-mono`, `--font-hanken`). Display headings use `font-display` (Hanken), everything else `font-sans` (Geist).

## Pattern & motif assets

- `apps/web/public/patterns/`: pattern tiles as SVGs (`arcs-<color>-on-<color>.svg` etc.), referenced by DESIGN_SYSTEM.md ("generate patterns randomly from ./patterns") and rendered by `process/pattern-tile.tsx`.
- `apps/web/public/logo.svg`: the MGM logo.
- `apps/web/public/logo/`: department logos (`curriculum.svg`, `hr.svg`, `infra.svg`, `media.svg`, `pr.svg`, `rnd.svg`). ⚠️ **This directory is currently untracked** (`?? apps/web/public/logo/` in git status); it was deliberately left alone during past work. If a change should ship these, confirm with the owner first.
- Note: DESIGN_SYSTEM.md's relative paths (`./logo.svg`, `./patterns`) resolve to `apps/web/public/`.

## Motif system (Core Competencies and preserved menu tiles)

`components/sections/competency-motif.tsx` exports the geometric shapes used across cards and menu tiles. Two consumers with different styling:

- `CompetencyCardShape`: full-card background motif on competency card fronts (clipped by the card's rounded edge; it is **scale-animated only, never rotated**, because its cut corners/ring gap would swing to broken-looking positions).
- `CompetencyMotifShape`: small watermark motifs, `stroke` prop for translucent white (`rgba(255,255,255,0.32)` / `0.16`) on colored fills.

Nav bento tiles pair each item with a `motif` (`ring | bracket | cross | chevron`) and/or a `pattern` tile (`PatternKind`) plus a `tone` (`PatternTone` = one of the 4 brand colors). The preserved Focus tiles mirror the homepage competency cards' motifs and colors (Game & New Media = chevron/green, Website = ring/blue, Mobile = bracket/red, HCI/UX = cross/yellow) for continuity.

## Responsive conventions

- **Page-content side gutters**: `px-6 sm:px-10 lg:px-[55px]` (24px mobile → 40px tablet → 55px desktop) is the established tiering for a page's main content column (articles and publications follow it). A handful of older sections use a coarser two-tier `px-6 sm:px-[55px]` (24px → 55px, no tablet step). Both exist in the codebase; if a page has multiple content sections, make sure they all use the **same** tiering, or they'll visibly mis-align at tablet widths (a real bug once: the article detail page's "Other articles" section used the two-tier version while the article body above it used three-tier, giving it noticeably wider gutters at tablet width until fixed).
- **`placeholder-shown:truncate` for search-input placeholders**: a bare `truncate` (⇒ `overflow-hidden` + `text-overflow: ellipsis` + `white-space: nowrap`) on an `<input>` applies to the _typed value_ too, not just the placeholder, which can fight the input's native "scroll to keep the cursor visible while typing a long value" behavior (`text-overflow: ellipsis` on an input is a known browser quirk here). Scope it to only the empty state with the `placeholder-shown:` variant instead: `placeholder-shown:truncate`. Verified: `text-overflow` reads `ellipsis` while the placeholder shows and reverts to the native `clip` the moment a value is typed, with the input's `scrollLeft` still advancing normally to keep the cursor in view.
- **Decorative motifs must stay clear of text at every breakpoint they're visible at**, not just desktop. Several `FlairShape`/`BauhausField` placements were tuned assuming a desktop-only gutter between the shape and a centered text column, and silently started overlapping headings once that gutter didn't exist below `lg:`. When adding a decorative shape near text, check it at the narrowest width it's visible at, not just where it was designed.
- **GSAP animation setup should be scoped to the breakpoint its target is actually visible at**, using `gsap.matchMedia()`. A `hidden lg:block` element (or any element hidden by a CSS class) still gets its transforms computed if a mount effect sets up a ScrollTrigger/tween/rAF loop for it unconditionally. `gsap.matchMedia(); mm.add("(min-width: 1024px)", () => { ...setup...; return cleanup; })` scopes both the setup and its cleanup to the query, and re-runs automatically on a resize across the breakpoint. See `about/bauhaus-field.tsx` for the pattern (it was previously running its scroll-triggered entrance, idle loops, and a mousemove parallax listener on every mobile visit for shapes that were `display: none` the whole time).

## Themed pages (projects and articles)

Project detail pages and article pages are the deliberate exceptions to the closed palette (`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §2.5). `apps/web/src/lib/project-themes.ts` holds 20 contrast-checked presets with light and dark variants. The page puts the active variant on `:root` as `--project-*` variables through a `<style>` it renders, so the variables exist only while it is mounted, and the header reads them with fallbacks to the site tokens. See `docs/projects-page.md`. Article pages use the same presets and the same mechanism.

The articles library around them has its own world tokens for both schemes (`components/articles/world/palette.ts`), uploaded raw to the WebGL pipeline so the hex values show as written. The DOM on those pages (the list's head, the cards' DOM copies, the cursor ring) reads them through `--world-*` custom properties set per scheme in `app/articles/articles.css` (mirroring `palette.ts`), so it stays theme-aware like everything else. See `docs/articles-page.md`.

## Theme awareness rules

- Never hardcode a color that should follow theme. Use tokens/utilities. Surfaces: `--surface-muted` for panels (menu), `--background` for pages.
- Elements hidden pre-hydration must use **opacity/visibility classes only** (`invisible opacity-0`), never transform classes GSAP owns (see `docs/animation-system.md` §Gotcha 1).
- Dark-mode regressions are a known failure class, so always test both themes (Playwright `colorScheme: "dark"`).

## Social glyphs

`components/social-icons.tsx`: hand-drawn glyphs (Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub, WhatsApp), all `currentColor` so they adapt to theme text color. Each accepts a `ref` (React 19 ref-as-prop) so the nav can run GSAP hover timelines on the SVG element itself. The current menu selects Instagram and LinkedIn through `data/nav.ts`.
