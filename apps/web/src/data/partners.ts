// Every logo here is a straight-from-the-source brand mark with its
// background removed (flood-filled from the image edges, so enclosed white
// shapes like Tokopedia's owl eyes survive) and re-encoded to WebP with
// alpha, or a true vector SVG. Logos render in their real colors directly on
// the page background in both themes. Per-theme adjustment is either
// `invertInDark` (a handful of near-black wordmarks, safe to CSS-invert
// wholesale) or `logoDark` (an explicit swapped-in asset, used whenever only
// the text needed to change and the mark itself had to stay untouched).
//
// Order is by public recognizability, most to least, not by importance to
// the lab or research strength. Signal: Wikipedia monthly pageviews summed
// over the trailing 12 months (2026-09), from a verified title match (the
// page's own extract had to mention the entity, not just a fuzzy search
// hit — e.g. a bare search for "fxMedia" resolves to the FX TV channel, a
// bare search for "Saga University" resolves to a random film article).
// tiket.com and Blibli resolve to the same Wikipedia article and therefore
// tie exactly, since the two companies merged and now share one page.
// Entities with no Wikipedia presence sit in an unranked tail, ordered
// alphabetically rather than guessed. Nanyang Technological University and
// Hiroshima University, and Mekari's position next to tiket.com, are
// explicit manual placements requested on top of the pageview ranking.
